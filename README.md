Solution helps to identify documents that have been modified.Documents such as an Income Statement or pictures are run through a ML algorithm that can provide a risk score on the authenticity of each document. 

It employs a deep neural network that looks at the relationship of each pixel on the document and calculates if any modifications were made.

Eg. If a person gets into a car accident and exaggerates his carâ€™s damage by editing the picture of his car to claim more insurance than needed, the model would be able to pick it up to declare its false authenticity.

This solution can be applied in the insurance industry or public sector to increase the efficiency and accuracy of processing workloads in high volumes.
